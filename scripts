SCANNING

nmap -A -T4 -oX scan.xmal <IP>

nmap — runs the network scanner program Nmap against the target IP.
-A — enables aggressive detection: OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.
-T4 — sets timing to "aggressive" for faster scanning (uses more parallelism; be cautious on unstable networks).
-oX scan.xmal — tells Nmap to write XML output to the file scan.xmal (likely a typo — normally scan.xml).
